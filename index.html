            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a
                business partnership.[8][11] The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and
                hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[12][13] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of
                transportation, a VW Bus, for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for US$500
                (equivalent to $2,381 in 2021).[14] Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer
                Club in July 1976.[15][16] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video
                chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer.[17] It went on
                sale soon after debut for US$666.66 (equivalent to $3,175 in 2021).[18][19][20][21][22]: 180  Wozniak

            <h3>Decline</h3>
            <p>The company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lower-cost models, the Macintosh
                Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up
                demand.[72] In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current
                shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the
                Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.
